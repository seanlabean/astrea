# astrea

## This is a work in progress... come back again soon!

## Overview
Astrea is a custom static site generator meant to ease the experience of keeping website file headers and footers consistent while still permitting the creative freedom of writing in pure html.

## Philosophy
I am of the opinion that the best and most meaningful personal blogs are born out of simplicity. In this spirit, I desiged my own website manager which forces me to be creative given a set of simple and restrictive rules. I am exceedingly impressed by what I can do with html and css I write by hand rather than what I can build using a paid-for website service. I encourage others to give this tool a try. Discover what you can make when you have full control over your website/blog/digital garden.

## How to use

An unfinished version of Astrea lives in purgatory in my [PythonProjects](https://github.com/seanlabean/PythonProjects/tree/master/SiteGenerator) repository.
